## Steps a user takes will have numbers.

## What we want to happen visually for the user will be below the step, indented.

### 1) Clicks the 'start quiz' button.

    Timer starts counting down by one second continuously and user is presented with the first multiple choice question.

### 2) Clicks an answer.

    A new question appears with its multiple choice options and the result/status of the prior question is shown as 'correct' or 'wrong.'  If the user selected a 'wrong' answer, the timer is reduced by 10 seconds.

### 3) Repeats step 2 until the game is over.

    The game is 'over' when all questions are answered or timer has 0 seconds remaining.  The user receives their score and can input their initials to save to a 'highscores' list by clicking the 'submit' button.

### 4) Types in initials and clicks 'submit.'

    A list of Highscores is displayed.  The user can click 'go back' and be taken to the start of the quiz, or 'clear highscores' to clear the entire list.
